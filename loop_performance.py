General Objective

    Create a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using
        For Loop
        While Loop

    Import the time module
        Measure the execution time of each function
        Call the functions using different values of n (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000)
        Record the execution time

Based on the experiment, which of the two loops performs much faster?

 

Here's a python code you can use to measure the execution time of a function

import time

n = 1000

time_start = time.time()

for_loop_function(n)

time_end = time.time()

time_total = time_end - time_start

print(time_total)General Objective
